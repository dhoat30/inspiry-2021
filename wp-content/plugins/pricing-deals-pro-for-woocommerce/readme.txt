* Enhancement - For Pricing Deals Settings page -- Show Discount as Unit Price Discount or Coupon Discount 
           	If "Coupon Discount" selected, the 
           	** single automatic coupon name showing the discounting **  
           	can be custom named in the new "Automatic Coupon Name" field directly below 
* Enhancement - If rule discount is activated by a WOO coupon ("Discount Coupon Code"), the WOO coupon is now
           	automatically created as well.

           	in a "coupon code ... 00" cart totals line.

           	On the Pricing Deals Settings page, look for:

* Enhancement - Allow additional product types from additional plugins

         	If added PRODUCT type from additional Plugins needed
                   Find all the Product types needed in your additional plugins, by searching for: "register_post_type".
                   In the "return" statement below, string them together as the example suggests
           
        	//add the 'add_filter...' statement to your theme/child-theme functions.php file 
        	add_filter( 'vtprd_use_additional_product_type', function() { return (array('product-type1','product-type2')); } ); 
          
                   THIS FILTER will add your added PRODUCT type to BOTH the PRODUCT selector AND the Pricing Deal Category selector
                   - so if you want a group of products to be included in a rule, you can either list them in the PRODUCT selector,
                   or make sure they participate in a Pricing Deal Category, which is then selected in your desired rule.

          	//add the 'add_filter...' statement to your theme/child-theme functions.php file

                      //--------------------------------------------------------------------

                      //- Discount the item(s) in the GET Group of equal or lesser value to the most expensive item in the BUY Group
